Took a big swing!
So best friends got each other's back
We used to cruise around, woofer bass to the max
Everyone at school while I was in the lab
Cooking up some beats that would turn into tracks
High school chilling, I was on a mission
I had bigger dreams of being a musician
Teachers always talked but I couldn't seem to listen
I lived in a fantasy land, they called it fiction

But I was gonna big one day
Playing shows on the road to a sold out stage
Nobody really cared or believed I would make
It anywhere close, I would fail and fade
But that's cool, I love that
'Cause any little doubt gives me energy back
And now, I'm in a place where I'm glad
I never gave up on the dreams I had

And big dreams lead to big things
And big swings lead to big rings
Championships or the big screen
Anyone who did anything took a big swing

And big dreams lead to big things
And big swings lead to big rings
Championships or the big screen
Anyone who did anything took a big swing

Took a big swing!

Yeah, let's go
Took a big swing!

So if you want something big
You gotta swing fast, swing hard and commit
You might miss 10 times, but when you hit
Just make sure that you get all of it, okay?
People at the top took risk
Investing and testing is all that they did
It's not complicated, it just takes grit
So never give up, take a swing at it, uh

And big dreams lead to big things
And big swings lead to big rings
Championships or the big screen
Anyone who did anything took a big swing

And big dreams lead to big things
And big swings lead to big rings
Championships or the big screen
Anyone who did anything took a big swing

Took a big swing!

Took a big swing!

Took a big swing!

Took a big swing!
